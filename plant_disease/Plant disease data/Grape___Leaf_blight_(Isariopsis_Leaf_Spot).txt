IntroductionMost cultivated grapevines are susceptible to various diseases,such as downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola (Berk. & M.A. Curtis)Berl. & De), anthracnose (Elsinoe ampelina Shear), isariopsis leafspot (Pseudocercospora vitis (Lév.) Speg.), gray rot (Botrytis cinereaPers) and ripe rot (Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld &Schrenk). Thus, control methods for these diseases are necessaryand of particular importance because they need to be effective andefﬁcient and should still result in a competitive production cost inthe market (Farjado, 2003).The most widely used fungicide to control diseases of grapevineis Bordeaux mixture, a copper fungicide. However, like all coppercompounds, this fungicide may produce symptoms of toxicity inyoung plant tissues, and the corrosive action of the fungicide maycompromise the structure of the vine. Due to these characteristics,Bordeaux mixture is recommended for use only after fruiting. Othersynthetic fungicides, such as metalaxyl, thiophanate-methyl andcymoxanil, are used on a large scale in the wine industry for thecontrol of these diseases (Amorim and Kuniyuki, 2005).The use of fungicides can increase production signiﬁcantly.However, fungicide use can also cause serious damage to theenvironment and can result in the selection of pathogens that areresistant to certain active ingredients contained in the fungicides.Consumers of fresh fruit are increasingly concerned about theorigin of the products that they purchase, the presence of toxicwaste and the conservation of the fruit. For this reason, the con-sumption of organic products has increased steadily, causingchanges in the production, storage, distribution and marketing ofagricultural products (Flores-Cantillano et al., 2001). This ecologicalawareness has created opportunities for agriculture, enhancingtrade in organic products and leading some growers to shift from*Corresponding author.

conventional production to organic or integrated production(Detoni et al., 2005).Accordingly, it is necessary to use alternative methods to controldiseases that occur in organic agriculture. Among these alternativemethods are the induction of resistance in plants (Bonaldo et al.,2005) and the use of natural bioactive substances with antimicro-bial activity (Camili et al., 2007). In this context, the use of essentialoils extracted from medicinal plants that contain secondary com-pounds can have both fungitoxic actions (antimicrobial action) andfacilitate resistance by activating defense mechanisms in plants(indirect antimicrobial action). For these reasons, the use of theseessential oils may represent a promising alternative in organicagriculture (Franzener et al., 2003).Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus (DC) Stapf), a member of thefamily Poaceae, is a medicinal plant that contains compounds thatcan potentially control pathogen-caused plant disease and/orinduce plant resistance to pathogens. This aromatic plant is culti-vated for the commercial production of an essential oil that iswidely used as a scenting agent in perfumery and cosmetics, in thepreparation of colognes, soaps and deodorants and in the phar-maceutical industry (Costa et al., 2005). Its typical major constitu-ents are citral monoterpenes (an isomeric mixture of neral andgeranial) and myrcene (Guimarães et al., 2011). According to Souzaet al. (1991), the citral monoterpenes show antimicrobial andantifungal activity, and these properties are currently attractingattention in agronomy.Pereira et al. (2012) evaluated the activity of essential oils ofCinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon), C. citratus (lemon grass),Syzygium aromaticum (clove), Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree),Thymus vulgaris (thyme), Azadirachta indica (neem), Corymbia cit-riodora (eucalyptus) and Cymbopogon nardus (citronella grass) tocontrol rust (Hemileia vastratrix Berk. & Br) in coffee seedlings in agreenhouse. The essential oil of lemon grass was found to reducethe severity of the disease by 67% and 70% in Catuaí IAC62 andCatuaí 2SL, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of theessential oil in controlling this disease.The effect of the essential oil of C. citratus on induced resistancehas been veriﬁed by Balbi-Peña et al. (2007), who used the oil totreat tomato plants inoculated with Alternaria solani. In that study,increased peroxidase activity at 12 and 48 h after inoculationFig. 1.

compared with plants treated with water indicated the potentialability of C. citratus essential oil to induce disease resistance inplants.In view of these ﬁndings, the aim of this study was to evaluatethe potential ability of the essential oil of lemon grass to controlisariopsis leaf spot (P. vitis) and downy mildew (P. viticola) and toinﬂuence productivity and enzyme activity in grapevine cv. Isabel(Vitis labrusca L.).2. Material and methodsThe experiment was conducted in a commercial vineyard withcv. Isabel under the conventional culture system during twoconsecutive cycles in 2011 (August/December) and 2012 (February/July). The vines, in their eighth year of production, were grafted onrootstock ‘420-A’, spaced at 2.0 2.5 m and trained on a pergolasystem. The vineyard was located in the municipality of Marialva,Paraná, Brazil (2327049.8600S, 5147018.7400W) at an altitude of614 m. The climate is Cfa (humid sub-tropical) according to theKöppen classiﬁcation (SIMEPAR, 2012). The soil at the site selectedfor the experiment was classiﬁed as a typic eutrophic and eutrophicred clay soil of loamy soil, and the terrain ranged from ﬂat to rolling(EMBRAPA, 2006).The essential oil of lemon grass was obtained from dried leaves,previously kept at room temperature, by steam drag distillation at120C for two hours. The molecules of essential oils evaporatealong with water vapor through the distiller, are immediatelycooled and condense along with the water. The water layer andthe essential oil differ in density and are separated with a drop-ping funnel (Worwood, 1995). The lemon grass leaves were ob-tained from the orchard at the Experimental Farm of Iguatemi-State University of Maringá (UEM). Doses of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and4.0 mL L1essential oil were applied to the grape plants. To sol-ubilize the oil, TweenÒ80% was used in a 1:1 proportion ofessential oil: TweenÒ80%. To compare the plants in these ﬁvetreatments with plants subjected only to a standard treatment,standard treatments with TweenÒ80%, Bordeaux mixture,Acibenzolar-S-methyl and mancozeb were applied to differentplants. The standard treatments were applied as follows. Bordeauxmixture was used in a 1:1:100 proportion of copper sulfate: lime:water. Acibenzolar-S-methyl (S-methyl-Acibenzolar) was used at50 mg L1, and mancozeb (DithaneÒ) was applied at 3 kg offormulated product per hectare.The treatments were applied weekly with a hand sprayer duringthe cooler hours of the day. Spraying was performed until liquidwas observed to drip from the plants. The treatments were appliedfrom the beginning of sprouting on 30/08/2011 and 14/02/2012, atotal of 10 applications. The experimental design was a randomizedblock with nine treatments and ﬁve replicates, and one plant wasused to represent a plot.The plants were observed to detect the onset of symptoms. Thenatural occurrence and severity of the symptoms, the presence ofisariopsis leaf spot (after the fourth application of the treatment inboth crop cycles) and the presence of downy mildew (after theseventh application of the treatment in both crop cycles) wereevaluated based on observations of three leaves from the median offour previously identiﬁed branches per plant. Diagrammatic scaleswere used to evaluate the presence of the diseases. A diagrammaticscale of one to six, corresponding to a range of lesions of 1.6% (i.e.,lesions present on 1.6% of the leaves examined) to 40.20% (Lenzet al., 2009) was used to evaluate the presence of isariopsis leafspot; a diagrammatic scale of one to twelve, corresponding to arange of lesions of 0e100%, was used to evaluate the presence ofdowny mildew (Azevedo, 1997). Disease severity was determinedFig. 2. Number of clusters (A and B) and productivity (C and D) of cv.

by the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). The AUDPCwas calculated for the time period between the day on which thedisease was initiated and the twenty-ﬁfth day after the initiation ofthe disease. The AUDPC was calculated as follows according to themethod described by Campbell and Madden (1990). To plot thedisease progress curve, a total of ﬁve evaluations were performed atintervals of seven days. The following equation (Campbell andMadden, 1990) was used to calculate the AUDPC:Fig. 3.

The percent reduction of disease was deter-mined for each treatment in comparison to the control. The controlwas considered to represent a severity of 100%.Additionally, assessments of productivity and grape qualitywere performed in two consecutive years. The variables analyzed tocalculate the value of productivity were the number of clusters perplot and the average weight of the clusters. Productivity (tons ha1)was estimated from these data. To determine the physical andchemical characteristics of the fruits, three fruits per plot werecollected. To represent each plot, the three fruits from that plotwere placed in a centrifugal home juice extractor and crushed. ABrix degree scale, based on speciﬁc gravity at 16C/16C, was usedto measure the content of total soluble solids (TSS). The TSS contentwas determined using a portable refractometer and expressed inBrix. The titratable acidity (TA) was obtained by titration of thejuice with a 0.1 N standardized solution of NaOH. A pH of 8.2 wasused as the endpoint of the titration. The result was expressed as apercentage of tartaric acid (Instituto Adolfo Lutz, 1985). The pH wasmeasured with a TEC-11 pH meter.For biochemical analysis, the collection of plant material (leaves)was performed in ﬁve stages. For the 2011 harvest, leaves werecollected 24 h (ﬁrst collection) and 48 h (second collection) afterthe second application, 24 h before the third application (thirdcollection) and 24 h (fourth collection) and 48 h (ﬁfth collection)after the third application. For the 2012 harvest, leaves werecollected at 24 h (ﬁrst collection) and 48 h (second collection) hoursafter the fourth application, 24 h before the ﬁfth application (thirdcollection), 24 h (fourth collection) and 48 h (ﬁfth collection) afterthe ﬁfth application. Samples were collected from the plants thatreceived doses of essential oil (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mL L1) andfrom the plants treated with TweenÒ80% and Acibenzolar-S-methyl.Enzyme extracts were obtained by macerating 1 g of vine leavesin liquid nitrogen and then mechanically homogenizing themacerated leaves in 4 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer(pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mM EDTA and 1% (p/p) poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in a mortar. The homogenate was centri-fuged at 15,000 gfor 30 min at 4C. The supernatant, representingenzyme extract, was stored at 20C prior to analysis.The protein content was determined according to Bradford(1976). A total of 2.5 mL of Bradford reagent was added, withstirring, to 50mL of the supernatant. After 5 min, the absorbance at595 nm was read with a spectrophotometer. The protein concen-tration in mg per mL of sample (mg protein mL1) was determinedusing standard curve concentrations of bovine serum albumin(BSA) from 0 to 0.5 mg mL1. The standard curve for bovine serumalbumin was obtained by the methods speciﬁed by Bradford(1976).Chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) was assessed based on the release ofsoluble fragments of liquid CM-chitin-RBV (carboxymethyl-chitin-Remazol Brilliant Violet) from carboxymethylated chitin labeledwith Remazol brilliant violet (Loewe Biochemica GmbH) (Wirthand Wolf, 1990). For this determination, a total of 600mLofextraction buffer (100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2) was mixed with200mL of enzyme extract and 200mL of CM-chitin-RBV (2 mg L1).After 20 min of incubation at 40C, the reaction was quenched with200mL 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) followed by cooling on ice andcentrifugation at 10,000 gfor 5 min. The absorbance of the super-natant was determined at 550 nm. The results are expressed inabsorbance units min1mg1protein.Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) activity was quantiﬁed with the method ofGóth (1991), modiﬁed by Tomanková et al. (2006), using the stablecomplex formed by ammonium molybdate and hydrogen peroxide(A405). The enzyme extract (0.2 mL) was incubated in 1 mL reac-tion mixture containing 60 mM hydrogen peroxide in 60 mM pH 7.4potassium phosphate buffer at 38C for 4 min. A total of 1 mL of32.4 mM ammonium molybdate was added after 4 min of incu-bation to end the consumption of hydrogen peroxide by theenzyme present in the extract. A blank was prepared for eachsample by adding ammonium molybdate to the reaction mixtureand omitting the incubation period. The yellow complex ofmolybdate and hydrogen peroxide was measured at 405 nm. Thedifference between the absorbance of the blank and the absorbanceof the incubated sample indicated the amount of hydrogenperoxide used by the enzyme. The concentration of hydrogenperoxide was determined using a value of Є¼0.0655 mM1cm1for the extinction coefﬁcient.A qualitative analysis of the essential oils was performed withgas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GCeMS). Theanalysis used a Thermo Electron FOCUS GC chromatographequipped with a DB-5ms fused silica capillary column(30 m 0.25 mm, 0.25 mm in stationary phase) and a ThermoElectron DSQ II mass spectrometer. The operating conditions wereas follows: injector temperature 200C, ﬂow rate of carrier gas(helium) 1.0 mL/min, injection volume 0.5mL (dichloromethanesolution) to ﬂow division (“split”) in a ratio of 1:40. The oventemperature program was 40C for 6 min, then increased to180C at a rate of 3C/min and then from 180C to 220Catarate of 10C/min, ﬁnally remaining at 220C for 20 min. Massspectra were obtained via electron impact ionization at 70 eV in arange of 40e650 m/z with an interface temperature of 250C anda200C ion source.

Signif-icant results were analyzed with a Tukey test to compare meansand with a polynomial regression. A 5% signiﬁcance level was usedfor all tests. All calculations were performed with the SISVAR sta-tistical program (Ferreira, 2011).3. Results and discussionThe AUDPC analysis showed that the essential oil of lemon grassaffected the severity of leaf spot in both of the two consecutivecycles examined (Fig. 1A and B). The application of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and4.0 mL L1of essential oil produced decreases in the AUDPC ofapproximately 40%, 48%, 42% and 42%, respectively, an apparentquadratic effect.

strong as the effects of the chemical treatment, which decreasedthe AUDPC by 76% for the 2011 harvest (Fig. 1A). In the second cycle,in 2012, the doses of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mL L1essential oil oflemon grass did not show signiﬁcantly different effects on theAUDPC. These doses resulted in decreases of approximately 34%,35%, 38% and 32%, respectively (Fig. 1B).The essential oil of lemon grass also showed a quadratic effecton the AUDPC for mildew for the 2011 harvest. Doses of 0.5, 1.0 and2.0 mL L1of the essential oil of lemon grass decreased the AUDPCby 45%, 48% and 46%, respectively. These values did not differ fromthe effects of treatment with Bordeaux mixture, Acibenzolar-S-methyl or mancozeb (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained inthe second year. Doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mL L1essential oil of lemongrass reduced the AUDPC by approximately 43% and 48%, respec-tively, compared with the control. These values did not differsigniﬁcantly from the 58% decrease in the AUDPC produced by themancozeb treatment (Fig. 1D). The results of this study also showedthat the 80% Tween used as an adjuvant did not inﬂuence thecontrol of isariopsis leaf spot or downy mildew.Few research reports have addressed the use of medicinal plantsin the control of grapevine diseases based on experiments con-ducted in the ﬁeld. However, results similar to those of the presentstudy were obtained by Pereira et al. (2012), who evaluated theeffectiveness of essential oils of C. zeylanicum (cinnamon), C. cit-ratus (lemon grass), S. aromaticum (clove), M. alternifolia (tea tree),T. vulgaris (thyme), A. indica (neem), C. citriodora (eucalyptus) and C.nardus (citronella grass) in the control rust in coffee seedlings in agreenhouse. The results of this previous study showed that a doseof 1.0 mL L1of essential oil reduced the severity of the disease by67% and 70% in Catuaí IAC62 and Catuai 2SL, respectively. Theessential oils of lemon grass, tea tree, thyme, citronella grass,eucalyptus and neem at a dose of 1.0 mL L1have been found toreduce the AUDPC of brown eyespot (caused by Cercospora coffei-cola Berk & Cooke) by 27.68%, 20.36%, 18.39%, 18.03%, 16.95% and15.43%, respectively, in coffee plants cv. Catuaí 2SL maintained in agreenhouse (Pereira et al., 2011).The results of the present study showed that the severity ofdisease, as measured by the AUDPC, was greater for the off-seasonharvest (2012). It is possible that the results for 2011, the previousyear of the cycle, were inﬂuenced by the prevailing climaticconditions.The major portion of the productive cycle of the grapevineoccurred in the rainy season of 2012 (510 mm total rainfallaccompanied by a relative humidity of approximately 70% eSIMEPAR, 2012), favoring an increase in the severity of leaf spot andmildew.Accordingly, this study shows that the essential oil of lemongrass is effective in controlling grapevine diseases even underconditions that favor disease development. In terms of the physicalcharacteristics of the crop, the sample taken from the ﬁrst harvestat 123 days after pruning showed that the doses of the essential oilhad no signiﬁcant effect on the mass of the clusters evaluated(Table 1). However, the number of clusters per plant and the yieldwere affected by the treatment with the essential oil. Themaximum values of these two variables occurred at estimateddoses of the essential oil of lemon grass of 2.98 and 2.57 mL L1,respectively (Figs. 2A and C). A dose of 2.0 mL L1of essential oil oflemon grass increased the cluster number and yield by 63% and48%, respectively, compared with the control. These values did notdiffer signiﬁcantly from those produced by the chemical treatment.In the second harvest, performed 127 days after pruning, aquadratic effect of the dose of the essential oil of lemon grass wasfound on the number of clusters, the cluster weight and the yield.The estimated doses corresponding to the maximum values ofthese three variables were 2.37, 1.25 and 2.55 mL L1, respectively(Figs. 2B, D and 3C). Of the doses tested, 2.0 mL L1essential oil oflemon grass increased the number of clusters per plant by 92% andthe yield by 150%. These values differed signiﬁcantly from thoseproduced by Bordeaux mixture and by mancozeb (Figs. 2B and D).In terms of the chemical characteristics of the grapes, the dosesof essential oil of lemon grass had no signiﬁcant effect on pH in2011 (Table 1). However, the dose of essential oil had a quadraticeffect on TA, TSS and TSS/TA (Fig. 3 and Table 1). A dose of0.5 mL L1of essential oil of lemon grass caused the acidity todecrease by 37% compared with the control. This value did notdiffer signiﬁcantly from that produced by the mancozeb treatment(Fig. 3A). The maximum values of the soluble solids and maturationindex were observed at estimated doses of 2.26 and 1.85 mL L1,respectively. A dose of 2.0 mL L1caused an increase of 100% in thematuration index relative to that found for the control treatment.This 100% increase differed signiﬁcantly from the 46% increase inthe maturation index produced by mancozeb, suggesting an effectprior to maturation (Fig. 3B).For the 2012 harvest, doses of the essential oil of lemon grass didnot affect the chemical characteristics of the grapes. The effect ofthese doses did not differ signiﬁcantly from those of the standardtreatments (Table 2). The treatment with 80% Tween did not in-ﬂuence the physicochemical properties of the grapes.According to Rizzon and Link (2006), the maturation indexrepresents the balance between the sweet and sour tastes of grapejuice. Speciﬁcally, higher values of the maturation index indicatethat the juice tastes sweeter. This balance reﬂects the relationshipbetween TSS and TA. Accordingly, it appears that, although the TSSobtained in the second year of production was not high, thematuration index was within the optimal range for obtainingquality juices. Rizzon et al. (1998) pointed out the maturation indexas the most important chemical characteristic to consider at thetime of the selection of grapes for processing. In the present study,the grapes had TA levels during the growing off-season that werelower than those obtained in the 2011 harvest. Colombo et al.(2011) suggest that the development of acidity in the grape is dueprimarily to the degradation of malic acid, which is favored byhigher air temperature and the stage of maturation of the grapes.In this context, the plants treated with the essential oil of lemongrass showed improvement in two consecutive years in the char-acteristics of the grape related to the quality of the fruit for use inwine production.The essential oil altered the metabolism-based disease resis-tance in grapevine, in part by causing an increase in chitinase ac-tivity. For 2011, the dose of the essential oil of lemon grass showedquadratic effects on the activity of chitinase for all evaluationTable 3Dynamics of chitinase in leaves of cv.

periods except 24 h after the third spray, which showed a lineareffect of the essential oil on chitinase activity (Fig. 4, C, E and G). Themaximum values of chitinase activity were obtained for estimateddoses of 2.57, 1.62 and 1.45 mL L1for the periods 24 and 48 h afterthe second spray and 48 h after the third spraying, respectively. Thegreatest percentage (300% and 181%) increase in chitinase activitywas observed at a dose of 2.0 mL L124 h after the second appli-cation and at a dose of 0.5 mL L148 h after the third spraying,respectively. These values differed signiﬁcantly from those pro-duced by Acibenzolar-S-methyl, which increased the chitinase ac-tivity 219% and 60% compared with the control. No signiﬁcantregression relationship between chitinase activity and the dose ofessential oil was found 24 h before the third spraying, but the doseof 0.5 mL L1showed higher chitinase activity that differedsigniﬁcantly from the control value and from the value for theAcibenzolar-S-methyl treatment (Table 3).In the second harvest, the dose of essential oil of lemon grasshad a quadratic effect on chitinase activity 24 h after spraying(Fig. 4B and F). A dose of 2.0 mL L124 h after the third sprayingproduced chitinase activity that was four times greater than thecontrol value. This increase was less than that found for theAcibenzolar-S-methyl treatment, which produced a level of chiti-nase activity ten times greater than that found for the control(Fig. 4B). The maximum chitinase activity 24 h after the fourthspraying resulted from an estimated dose of 1.83 mL L1(Fig. 4F). Adose of 1.0 mL L1increased chitinase activity by approximately37% compared with the control. However, no signiﬁcant differencewas found among the treatments. No signiﬁcant regression rela-tionship between chitinase activity and the dose of essential oil wasfound 24 h before the ﬁfth spraying. However, a dose of 0.5 mL L1resulted in chitinase activity that was signiﬁcantly higher than thevalues for the control and for the Acibenzolar-S-methyl treatment(Table 3). For samples taken 48 h after spraying, the dose of theessential oil had a positive linear effect on chitinase activity (Fig. 4Dand H). Forty-eight hours after the second and third sprayings, thehighest dose of the essential oil produced an increase in chitinaseactivity that was ﬁve to ﬁfteen times greater, respectively, than thecorresponding values found for the control treatment. The in-creases resulting from this dose of the essential oil differed signif-icantly from the corresponding increases resulting from theAcibenzolar-S-methyl treatment. The dose of 0.5 mL L1producedhigh chitinase activity even after six days of treatment applicationin two consecutive cycles, showing that the expression of theresistance induced by the plant can be observed for a longer time,as previously found by Kuc (1995).The antimicrobial activity of chitinase is based on an ability tohydrolyze chitin polymers, weakening the cell wall and making thecells osmotically sensitive (Selitrennikoff, 2001). It is possible thatthe effects of this mechanism are responsible for the reduction in theseverity of isariopsis leaf spot on the grape leaves. However, one ofthe primary characteristics of the causal agent of downy mildew, anobligate parasite belonging to the class Oomycetes, is an absence ofchitin in the cell wall (Massola Júnior and Krugner, 2011). In additionto the antimicrobial effects of chitinase, according to Yoshikawa et al.(1993), this enzyme acts indirectly by releasing fragments of thematerial components of plant cell walls (oligogalacturonides). Thesefragments serve to elicit defense responses in the host plant. Mostlikely, the treatments with the essential oil of lemon grass in thisstudy stimulated other mechanisms, e.g., the metabolic formation ofphytoalexins, to reduce the severity of downy mildew on thegrapevines. Poinssot et al. (2012) suggest that secondary metabolitessuch as resveratrol, derivatives and ﬂavonoidscontribute to cell wallstrengthening in grapevines in response to infection or treatmentwith agents that elicit defensive responses.The doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mL L1of essential oil of lemon grassproduced the lowest catalase activity, approximately 60% less thanthat observed for the control (Fig. 5A, C and G). These values ofcatalase activity did not differ from those resulting from theAcibenzolar-S-methyl treatment 24 h after the second spraying(Fig. 5A). Forty-eight hours after the second spraying, a dose of1.0 m L L1of the essential oil of lemon grass produced no catalaseactivity. This result differed signiﬁcantly from that found for theAcibenzolar-S-methyl treatment, which produced higher catalaseactivity (Fig. 5C). In the third collection, performed 24 h before thethird spraying, the effect of the essential oil was less than the effectof the Acibenzolar-S-methyl treatment, which decreased catalaseactivity by approximately 94% (Fig. 5D). Twenty-four hours afterthe third spraying, the lower doses of the essential oil also pro-duced lower catalase activity, a decrease of approximately 70%relative to the control. This value differed signiﬁcantly from thatproduced by the Acibenzolar-S-methyl treatment (Fig. 5G). Thedoses of 2.0 and 4.0mLL1essential oil decreased catalase activityby approximately 90% and 93%, respectively, relative to the control.These decreases differed signiﬁcantly from those produced by theAcibenzolar-S-methyl treatment (Fig. 5I).For the second harvest, the doses of essential oil showed aquadratic effect on catalase activity at all times of evaluation(Fig. 5B, D, F, H and J). The doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mL L1showedless activity, producing decreases in catalase activity of 73%, 76%and 80%, respectively, compared with the control. These valuesdiffered signiﬁcantly from those produced by the Acibenzolar-S-methyl treatment, which decreased catalase activity by 32% 24 hafter the third spraying (Fig. 5A). Forty-eight hours after spraying,doses of 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mL L1of essential oil caused decreases incatalase activity of 80%, 95% and 95%, respectively, compared withthe control. These values differed signiﬁcantly from the corre-sponding values for the other treatments (Fig. 5D). In the thirdsample, taken 24 h before spraying, treatment with essential oildecreased catalase activity by 89%e75% compared with the control.In contrast, the Acibenzolar-S-methyl treatment produced asmaller decrease, 41% (Fig. 5F). Essential oil doses of 0.5, 1.0 and2.0 mL L1caused decreases in catalase activity of approximately70%, 66% and 53%, respectively, compared with the control. Thesevalues did not differ signiﬁcantly from the values obtained with theAcibenzolar-S-methyl treatment 24 h after spraying (Fig. 5H).Additionally, the values of catalase activity obtained for theessential oil doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mL L148 h after spraying did notdiffer signiﬁcantly from the corresponding values obtained withthe Acibenzolar-S-methyl treatment.The plants treated with Acibenzolar S-methyl showed a signif-icant increase in catalase activity 48 h after the second spraying and48 h after the third spraying (Fig. 5A and I). Similarly, the plantstreated with various doses of essential oil showed increased cata-lase activity 24 h before the third spraying (Fig. 5E). During thesecond cycle, the plants treated with Tween 80Òshowed increasedcatalase activity for all periods (Fig. 5B, D, F, H and J). This resultappears to represent a response to the extremely high levels ofhydrogen peroxide that were most likely present.Fig. 5. Dynamics of catalase in leaves of grapevine cv.

Balbi-Peña et al. (2012) studied the defensive responses of agenotype of Solanum habrochaites resistant to Oidium neolycopersiciand a genotype of Solanum lycopersicum susceptible to this path-ogen. Those authors observed an increase in catalase activity 120 hafter inoculation, suggesting that detoxiﬁcation mechanisms(“scavenging”of excess hydrogen peroxide) can act in the laterstages of pathogenesis. A similar increase in catalase was also re-ported in the same pathosystem by Mlícková et al. (2004) andTománková et al. (2006).The reduction of catalase activity found in the present studymay represent evidence for the accumulation of hydrogen peroxideand reactive oxygen species (ROS). This response may contribute tothe resistance of plants to pathogens (Pascholati, 2011). Accordingto Resende et al. (2003), hydrogen peroxide is involved in manyplant resistance mechanisms, acting to reinforce the cell wall bycross-linking structural proteins or by acting on phenolic com-pounds to form an effective mechanical barrier.Trouvelot et al. (2008) used microscopy to investigate the ac-tivity ofb-1,3-glucan sulfate against downy mildew. That studyfound that the production of hydrogen peroxide is correlated withthe hypersensitive response (HR). The authors noted that anoxidative burst and the generation of ROS are observed in responseto infection with pathogens belonging to the class Oomycetes,resulting in cell death at the plant infection site (an HR). As a result,the HR is effective in disease resistance (Naton et al., 1996). As thecausal agent of downy mildew can also survive in mycelial form inthe living tissues of the host, localized cell death can limit theprogress of pathogens into the host (Dixon and Lamb, 1997).The chromatogram obtained from the analysis of the essentialoil of lemon grass is shown in Fig. 6. The components identiﬁed,together with their retention times (tr), Kovats retention indices(KI) and the sample contents, are shown in Table 4. The chro-matographic analysis identiﬁed seven compounds in the essentialoil of lemon grass:b-myrcene; 1.8 Cineole (eucalyptol); linalool,neral; geranial; 2-undecanone; and 2-tridecanone (Table 4).In this study, the essential oil of lemon grass was effective incontrolling isariopsis leaf spot and downy mildew in grapevine cv.Isabel and induced resistance to these diseases in the plant. It isprobable that citral (an isomeric mixture of neral and geranial) waspresent in the essential oil. Souza et al. (1991) showed that thiscomponent of the essential oil of lemon grass possesses substantialantibacterial and antifungal activity. Moreover, Balbi-Peña et al.(2007) found that the essential oil of C. citratus induced resis-tance in tomato plants against A. solani, with the highest peroxidaseactivity found at 12 and 48 h after inoculation compared with thevalues for a control treatment with water and for non-inoculatedplants.The essential oil of lemon grass contains citral and is effective incontrolling leaf spot and leaf and vine mildew in the ﬁeld. Mostlikely, the effectiveness of the essential oil for this purpose is due tothe production of resistance to pathogens through the induction ofthe enzymes chitinase and catalase and of other enzymes that maybe involved in the response. The use of the essential oil of lemongrass may represent a promising alternative for viticulture, servingto augment the desirable physicochemical characteristics of thegrape and increasing productivity and quality.4. ConclusionsDoses of the essential oil of lemon grass reduced the AUDPC forisariopsis leaf spot and downy mildew in two consecutive years.Doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mL L1of the essential oil reduced theseverity of downy mildew disease, measured by the AUDPC, byapproximately 45%.A dose of 2.0 mL L1of the essential oil increased the number ofclusters and productivity by 63% and 48%, respectively, in the ﬁrstcrop and by 92% and 150%, respectively, in the second crop.In the ﬁrst harvest, a dose of 2.0 mL L1of essential oil caused a100% increase in the maturation index, suggesting an effect prior toFig. 6.

In the second harvest, the treatments did notdiffer signiﬁcantly.The highest percentage increases in chitinase activity, 300% and181%, were observed at doses of 2.0 mL L124 h after the secondspraying and 0.5 mL L148 h after the third spraying, respectively.A chromatographic analysis showed that the essential oil oflemon grass contained citral (an isomeric mixture of neral andgeranial). Due to the presence of citral, the essential oil was effec-tive in disease control and in inducing disease resistance ingrapevine cv. Isabel
